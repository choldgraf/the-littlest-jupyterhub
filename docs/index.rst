The Littlest JupyterHub
-----------------------

A simple `JupyterHub <https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub>`_ distribution for
a small (0-50) number of users on a single server.

Quick Start
===========

On a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 server, you can install The Littlest JupyterHub with:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuvipanda/the-littlest-jupyterhub/master/bootstrap/bootstrap.py | sudo python3 -

This takes 2-5 minutes to run. When completed, you can access your new JupyterHub
at the public IP of your server! Read the :ref:`tutorial_quickstart` next.

If this installation method (``curl <arbitrary-url> | sudo bash -``)
makes you nervous, check out the :ref:`other installation methods <installation>` we support!
